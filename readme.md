 1. Drag 'n drop the "fb" folder to `*wordpress*/wp-includes/images/smilies/`
    This is the new smilies. The old smilies is still here.
 2. Replace smilies_init() in `*wordpress*/wp-includes/functions.php` with my smilies_init()
    This will replace the ugly, old smilies with flashbacks cool, awesome smilies.
 
**Note:**

If you update wordpress you will propably need to repeat step 2. (replace the smilies_init() functions again).
